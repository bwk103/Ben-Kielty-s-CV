## Ben Kielty

In my former life I worked at two of the most respected law firms in the country but, after ten years' experience in paralegal roles, I've challenged myself to learn to code and have enrolled at Makers Academy as part of their January 2017 cohort.  

At the moment, all I can say is that I'm looking for a new challenge and am excited about the journey that I'm shortly to undertake and all of the possibilities that may arise thereafter.

## Skills

#### Communication

I've always taken pride in my communication skills whether advising clients at court attendances and in prison environments or questioning witnesses in order to extract relevant evidence. As a volunteer with the Free Representation Unit I have successfully presented cases before employment tribunals and at interviews under caution in relation to DWP investigations.

I have actively engaged in colleague training and development in each of my employment roles, producing staff training manuals and presentations in order to promote efficiency and best practice.   

#### Analytical Approach

It is impossible to represent clients effectively without developing an analytical approach to cases.  Having worked on behalf of both the prosecution and the defence, I have experience of assessing the merits of cases, establishing the aims of investigations, actioning steps to achieve those aims and managing client expectations. This is a methodology which, I believe, can properly be transferred to software development.

I am able to quickly adapt to new concepts and apply them as part of my work.  At Capsticks I predominantly worked on behalf of the UK's professional dental regulator in investigating complaints against it's members. In order to improve my effectiveness in the role, within the first month I undertook a number of online dental training courses and engaged with the wider dental community in order to quickly establish a firm knowledge of dental terminology and methods.
