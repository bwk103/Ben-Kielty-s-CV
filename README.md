## Profile

I am a law graduate, a former Paralegal and an aspiring junior full-stack web developer. After ten years of working at well-respected law firms, I left the legal profession in 2016 and challenged myself to learn to code.

My experience at Makers Academy transformed me from someone with an interest in technology and code, into a developer with a good understanding of several languages and a desire to further broaden that knowledge. Since graduating, I have continued to undertake courses and have completed a number of personal projects using a variety of technologies.

I'm currently seeking a junior software development role which offers a challenging environment as well as one which can facilitate my personal growth as a developer.

## Projects

### Ruby

Both as part of the Makers course, and since graduating, I have completed a number of projects using Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and a number of other gems.

**[Whimple CC](https://github.com/bwk103/whimpleCC)** is a project in which I have attempted to re-design the website of a village cricket club.  The application uses a basic Ruby on Rails framework and lets users:

* View details of players, fixtures, results and forthcoming events at the club;
* See detailed performance figures for individual players; and
* Add, edit and delete players and events (admin only).

**[Fix City](https://github.com/bwk103/fix-city-1)** is an application which enables users to report minor civil issues, such as potholes or fly-tipping, to their local Council.
* I worked as part of a team to develop the application over the course of five days. The backend of the project uses Ruby on Rails and writes to a PostgreSQL database.  
* A number of Gems were also used including Paperclip (allowing users to upload images) and Cancancan (allowing user authorisations).  
* The JavaScript frontend also allows users to upload geolocation data using jQuery and Google Maps API.

**[instaRails](https://github.com/bwk103/instaRails)** is an Instagram clone built using Ruby on Rails and jQuery.
* Users can register/sign in/sign out and create edit and delete their accounts;
* When a registered user creates a post, submitted images are uploaded and resized using CarrierWave and ImageMagick.

**[CapyBnB](https://github.com/bwk103/byte4-makers-bnb)** is a basic Airbnb clone which allows hosts to post, edit and delete their properties and allows travellers to enquire and book locations.  
* The application was developed as part of a team of four people and over the course of five days.
* The application reads from, and writes to, a PostgreSQL database and uses BCrypt to maintain user security.

**[Chitter](https://github.com/bwk103/chitter-challenge)** is a basic Twitter clone which allows users to register / login and read and post short messages to each other.  
* The application was developed using Sinatra and uses DataMapper to write to a PostgresQL database.  
* This was also the first application in which I implemented the Model View Controller structure.

Other applications that I have developed using Ruby include a **[Yelp clone](https://github.com/bwk103/yelp_clone)** and **[Rock, Papers, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](https://github.com/bwk103/rps-challenge)**.

### Additional Technologies
* Excellent understanding of HTML, CSS, LESS and SASS with experience of using a variety of CSS frameworks including Bootstrap, Foundation and Pure. 
* Experience of using RSpec, Jasmine, Capybara, Mocha and Jest to successfully TDD various projects. 
* Knowledge of a variety of templating languages including HAML, ERB, EJS and Handlebars and experience of using Webpack as a module bundler for front-end work. 
* Familiarity with deploying applications to AWS, Heroku and Google Cloud as well as managing version control using Git and Docker.

### Javascript / Typescript

**[Makers Rooms](https://github.com/sliute/AlexaBookEvent)** was developed as part of my final project at Makers and allows users to manage meeting room bookings using an Amazon Echo.
* A user is able to enquire as to whether a meeting room is currently available and/or to make a booking at a particular time and date.
* The application was developed using Node.js and the 'Alexa-app' module and tested using Alexa-App-Server (feature tests) and Mocha/Chai (unit tests).
* The Node.js back-end reads and writes events to an instance of Amazon DynamoDB via AWS Lambda.

**[Quizzed](https://github.com/bwk103/Quizzed)** a basic quiz game using Vue.js components.
* A player is asked a question and then given a set amount of time in which to answer it.
* Each question can be given a variable time limit at the time that it is added to the database by the admin user.

**[BusTimes](https://github.com/bwk103/busSkill)** a skill for the Amazon Echo which tells the user when the next bus is due.
* Developed using Node.js, Amazon's Alexa Skill Development Kit, AWS Lambda and tested using bespoken-tools.
* Uses London Transport's API to obtain live bus information for a given bus stop.

**[Planter](https://github.com/bwk103/planter)** is an application which allows users to manage their lawn and garden plants.
* A user is able to log the details of plants in their garden and receive reminders as to maintenance work that is required (e.g. watering or pruning).
* The backend of the application uses Node.js and an Express framework and writes to a MongoDB database.  
* The frontend is a single-page web application developed using Angular 4.0 and Bootstrap.

**[Look Away Now](https://github.com/bwk103/look-away-now)** is an extension for Google Chrome which hides final scores on NFL.com and allows users to watch highlights without knowing the results.

## Voluntary Work

**Code Club**: May 2018 - present

As a Volunteer with Code Club, I have helped to establish and run a free coding club, based in Epsom, where young people are encouraged to learn web development by creating games, animations and basic websites using Scratch, HTML/CSS, Python and Raspberry Pis. Typical tasks associated with this role include:

* Selecting lesson plans based on students' progression and understanding of the prior weeks' project;
* Presenting the week's tasks and explaining any key concepts required to complete them;
* Supervising a class of up to 15 students whilst providing individual support and assistance where necessary; and
* Liasing with parents and guardians to provide feedback on student progression and to ensure legal and regulatory compliance (e.g when students create user accounts).
					
**Surrey County Council**: January 2018 - present

As a Digital Buddy with Surrey Libraries, I help people to resolve basic computer and technology queries during one-to-one sessions or as part of group open days. Through the scheme, I assist people of all ages and from a variety of backgrounds; from those with a good understanding of technology but who are experiencing an unusual software bug, to those using a computer for the very first time. Examples of typical queries that I encounter as a Digital Buddy include:

-	assisting with basic online tasks such as accessing websites, setting up email addresses, and recovering user accounts;

-	helping learners to use software packages, particularly Microsoft Office;

-	offering guidance on installing and using applications on smartphones and tablets; and

-	supporting and promoting the use of Surrey Librariesâ€™ digital services and membership.

## Personal Skills

### Communication
I am an excellent communicator, able to adapt across a wide range of scenarios, from advising clients within prison environments to leading team stand-ups or code reviews. I enjoy presenting to groups and have provided peer training talks in each of my employment roles.  

Furthermore, as an Advisor with the Free Representation Unit I successfully argued cases at employment tribunals which involved presenting evidence, cross examining witnesses and making persuasive closing submissions.

### Project Management / Analytical Approach


I particularly enjoyed the use of Agile and XP principles across my pair and team projects at Makers Academy and used a range of project management tools, including Trello and Taiga.

In my legal roles, having worked on behalf of both the prosecution and the defence, I have experience of assessing the merits of cases, establishing the aims of investigations and thereafter actioning steps to achieve those aims in line with client expectations. A methodology which, I believe, I have successfully transferred to each of my software development projects to date.

I am able to quickly adapt to new concepts and apply them as part of my work. Prior to the development of [Makers Rooms](https://github.com/sliute/AlexaBookEvent) I had no experience of Node.js or Amazon Web Services but, within a period of two weeks, was able to learn the hardware and each aspect of the stack in order to develop a successful product. Similarly, in previous employment roles I have always quickly learnt and adapted to the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks in order to make a contribution to teams as early as possible.
