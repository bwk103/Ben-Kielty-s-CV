## Profile

I am a law graduate and former Paralegal turned junior full-stack web developer via a twelve week coding bootcamp at Makers Academy.

After ten years of working at well-respected law firms, I left the legal profession in 2016 and challenged myself to learn to code. My experience at Makers Academy transformed me from someone with an interest in technology and code, into a developer with a good understanding of several languages and a desire to further broaden that knowledge.

Following my graduation in March 2017, I have continued to undertake courses and have completed a number of projects using the MEAN stack. I'm currently seeking a junior software development role which offers a challenging environment as well as one which can facilitate my personal growth as a developer.

## Skills

### Javascript / Typescript

**[Makers Rooms](https://github.com/sliute/AlexaBookEvent)** was developed as part of my final project at Makers and allows users to manage meeting room bookings using an Amazon Echo.
* A user is able to enquire as to whether a meeting room is currently available and/or to make a booking at a particular time and date.
* The application was developed using Node.js and the 'Alexa-app' module and tested using Alexa-App-Server (feature tests) and Mocha/Chai (unit tests).
* The Node.js backend reads and writes events to an instance of Amazon DynamoDB via AWS Lambda.

**[Planter](https://github.com/bwk103/planter)** is an application which allows users to manage their lawn and garden plants.
* A user is able to log the details of plants in their garden and receive reminders as to maintenance work that is required (e.g. watering or pruning).
* The backend of the application uses Node.js and an Express framework and writes to a MongoDB database.  
* The frontend is a single-page web application developed using Angular 4.0 and Bootstrap.

**[Look Away Now](https://github.com/bwk103/look-away-now)** is an extension for Google Chrome which hides final scores on NFL.com and allows users to watch highlights without knowing the results.


### Ruby

As part of the Makers course, I completed several projects using Ruby, Sinatra and Rails as well as a number of Gems.

**[Fix City](https://github.com/bwk103/fix-city-1)** is an application which enables users to report minor civil issues, such as potholes or fly-tipping, to their local Council.
* I worked as part of a team to develop the application over the course of five days. The backend of the project uses Ruby on Rails and writes to a PostgreSQL database.  
* A number of Gems were also used including Paperclip (allowing users to upload images) and Cancancan (allowing user authorisations).  
* The JavaScript frontend also allows users to upload geolocation data using jQuery and Google Maps API.   

**[CapyBnB](https://github.com/bwk103/byte4-makers-bnb)** is a basic Airbnb clone which allows hosts to post, edit and delete their properties and allows travellers to enquire and book locations.  
* The application was developed as part of a team of four people and over the course of five days.
* The application reads from, and writes to, a PostgreSQL database and uses BCrypt to maintain user security.

**[Chitter](https://github.com/bwk103/chitter-challenge)** is a basic Twitter clone which allows users to register / login and read and post short messages to each other.  
* The application was developed using Sinatra and uses DataMapper to write to a PostgresQL database.  
* This was also the first application in which I implemented the Model View Controller structure.

Other applications that I have developed using Ruby include a **[Yelp clone](https://github.com/bwk103/yelp_clone)** and **[Rock, Papers, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](https://github.com/bwk103/rps-challenge)**.

### Additional Languages
In working on the projects listed above, I have developed a good understanding of **HTML**, **CSS** and **SASS** and have experience of working with Bootstrap and Foundation front-end frameworks. I have successfully implemented **HAML**, **ERB**, **EJS** and **Handlebars** templating languages and have successfully deployed projects to AWS and Heroku.

## Further Skills

### Communication
I am an excellent communicator, able to adapt across a wide range of scenarios, from advising clients within prison environments to leading team stand-ups or code reviews. I enjoy presenting to groups and have provided peer training talks in each of my employment roles.  

Furthermore, as an Advisor with the Free Representation Unit I successfully argued cases at employment tribunals which involved presenting evidence, cross examining witnesses and making persuasive closing submissions.

### Project Management / Analytical Approach


I particularly enjoyed the use of Agile and XP principles across my pair and team projects at Makers Academy and used a range of project management tools, including Trello and Taiga.

In my legal roles, having worked on behalf of both the prosecution and the defence, I have experience of assessing the merits of cases, establishing the aims of investigations and thereafter actioning steps to achieve those aims in line with client expectations. A methodology which, I believe, I have successfully transferred to each of my software development projects to date.

I am able to quickly adapt to new concepts and apply them as part of my work. Prior to the development of [Makers Rooms](https://github.com/sliute/AlexaBookEvent) I had no experience of Node.js or Amazon Web Services but, within a period of two weeks, was able to learn the hardware and each aspect of the stack in order to develop a successful product. Similarly, in previous employment roles I have always quickly learnt and adapted to the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks in order to make a contribution to teams as early as possible.

I'm a PADI certified Advanced Open Water Diver, with a particular interest in wreck diving.
I enjoy travelling the world, and have been fortunate enough to have climbed Kilimanjaro, walked the Great Wall of China and dived the Great Barrier Reef.
