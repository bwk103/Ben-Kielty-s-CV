## Profile

I am a law graduate and former Paralegal turned junior full-stack web developer via a twelve week coding bootcamp at Makers Academy.

After ten years of working at well-respected law firms, I left the industry in 2016 and challenged myself to learn to code.  My experience at Makers Academy has transformed me from someone with an interest in technology and code, into a developer with a good understanding of several languages and a continuing desire to further learn and broaden my knowledge.

Following my graduation in March 2017, I'm now seeking a junior software development role which offers a challenging environment as well as one which can facilitate my personal growth as a developer.

## Skills

During the Makers Academy course, I gained experience using the following languages and technologies:

### Javascript
**Node.js:**
As part of my final project, I worked as part of a team developing [Makers Rooms](https://github.com/sliute/AlexaBookEvent), an Amazon Echo skill  for creating and managing meeting room bookings.  The skill was created using Node JS and testing locally using Mocha and Chai.

**jQuery:** As part of the development of [Fix City](https://github.com/KatHicks/fix-city) (a web application allowing individuals to report minor civil problems to their local council), I was responsible for integrating Google Maps API into the project and using jQuery in the submission of geolocation data.

### Amazon Web Services
Through the development of [Makers Rooms](https://github.com/sliute/AlexaBookEvent), I obtained experience using Amazon's **Alexa Skills Kit**, **Lambda** functions and **DynamoDB** services.  

### Ruby
**Rails:** The back-end of [Fix City](https://github.com/KatHicks/fix-city) uses Ruby on Rails and allows the user to save their reported incidents to a PostgreSQL database.  I have also used Rails to develop a basic ['Yelp' based restaurant application](https://github.com/bwk103/yelp_clone) which also users OmniAuth to authenticate users via their Facebook login details.

**Sinatra:**  
Using Sinatra, I developed [Chitter](https://github.com/bwk103/chitter-challenge) a Twitter clone which allows users to post and read short messages and '[Rock, Papers, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](https://github.com/bwk103/rps-challenge) which allows users to play a modern take on Rock, Paper Scissors.  Both applications were created using TDD methods, using RSpec and Capybara to conduct tests.

### Additional Languages
Many of my projects on the Makers Academy course also enabled me to develop my knowledge of **HTML** and **CSS** as well as **ERB** and **HAML**.

## Further Skills

### Communication
I am an excellent communicator, able to adapt across a wide range of scenarios, from advising clients within prison environments to leading team stand-ups or code reviews. I enjoy presenting to groups and have provided peer training talks in each of my employment roles.  

Furthermore, as an Advisor with the Free Representation Unit I successfully argued cases at employment tribunals which involved presenting evidence, cross examining witnesses and making persuasive closing submissions.

### Project Management / Analytical Approach


I particularly enjoyed the use of Agile and XP principles across my pair and team projects at Makers Academy and used a range of project management tools, including Trello and Taiga.

In my legal roles, having worked on behalf of both the prosecution and the defence, I have experience of assessing the merits of cases, establishing the aims of investigations and thereafter actioning steps to achieve those aims in line with client expectations. A methodology which, I believe, I have successfully transferred to each of my software development projects to date.

I am able to quickly adapt to new concepts and apply them as part of my work. Prior to the development of [Makers Rooms](https://github.com/sliute/AlexaBookEvent) I had no experience of Node.js or Amazon Web Services but, within a period of two weeks, was able to learn the hardware and each aspect of the stack in order to develop a successful product. Similarly, in previous employment roles I have always quickly learnt and adapted to the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks in order to make a contribution to teams as early as possible.
